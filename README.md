# Black-and-white-image-colorization-with-OpenCV-and-Deep-Learning
This repository contains a Python program that converts grayscale images to color using the Caffe colorization model with OpenCV. It reads images, loads the pre-trained model via the dnn module, and processes them to produce colorized outputs, demonstrating essential steps in deep learning-based image colorization.
